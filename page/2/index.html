        <h2><a href="/articles/changes/">Changes</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="content"><p>Of course there’s a reason I’m starting up a new blog — I’m making a change in my career and I’d like to start it off on the right&nbsp;foot.  </p>
<p>I’ve always been averse to change.  It makes my wife crazy because I resist her re-arranging the furniture.  I resist throwing out an old pair of sneakers and buying new ones.  Moving? I’ve told her I plan to die in our current&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>So making a career change is especially nerve-wracking.  I do not like it.  It usually takes quite a lot to “push” me out the door at a job, like not paying me (not the case this time) for a few months.  I grow attached to my projects.  I grow fond of my co-workers.  I get very comfortable in my little corner of the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>And I get stagnant.  I might get a bit <span class="caps">TOO</span> comfortable.  I start to turn a blind eye to some of the dirtier code corners in the&nbsp;project.  </p>
<p>So it’s time for a forced change.  A forced change that will lead to more changes.  I’m going back into the consulting field, where you don’t have as much opportunity to stagnate.  I’m excited about throwing myself in the deep end of new projects again.  And learning and helping and building upon that when I go to the next project.  I’ve done it before and know it will be challenging— and I think those challenges are exactly what I need today.  That doesn’t stop my heart from skipping a beat every time I start thinking about the changes coming&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>I’m sorry to leave my previous employer.  They have treated me exceedingly well and given me great freedom.  I hate it that my leaving will have even the slightest impact on them.  But it’s a choice I have to make eventually, and I can hope it will be good for both of us in the long&nbsp;run. </p>

I’m going to leave my old one up at <a href="http://jakeastevenson.blogspot.com/">http://jakeastevenson.blogspot.com/</a>, but it is ancient and I’m interested in learning about new blogging engines and starting fresh.  Here’s where I hope to record things I’ve learned and thoughts I have about my career&nbsp;development.</p>
